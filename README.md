# GFonts
Garry's Mod font health manager to keep sanity of your dynamically created fonts

Originally I created this as some servers with lots of addons try to create fonts over and over duplicating themselves in the engine for no reason
For me it reduced the amount of total fonts created by the engine from 800 to ~550 ish

This helping with the load times as it skips font creation for dupes, helps with memory mamangement of the engine as too much fonts isn't healthy in general
